## Using the app

Click "add" to add to the list

The button should disappear and be replaced by EditText

*Ideally* the keyboard would show up, but if not the soft keyboard input is essential for this to work, and can be pulled up using the tools that do pop up on the left.

Once the new city name is typed, press enter (on the soft keyboard)

To delete, click on a city name,

the add button should be replaced by the delete

press the delete to confirm its removal.
